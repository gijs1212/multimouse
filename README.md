# multimouse
multimouse is an tinytask alternative (now called remouse) it records mouse movement/clicks/scrolls and keyboard clicks. this is not paid, but it still needs work. feel free to publish better versions
make sure the .ico files are in the same folder as the .pyw file

## Standalone launchers
- `autosnap.pyw` – open the AutoSnap menu directly without the main MultiMouse window
- `autosnap_combi.pyw` – start the AutoSnap combi automation immediately; press `Esc` to stop
