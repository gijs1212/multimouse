# multimouse
multimouse is an tinytask alternative (now called remouse) it records mouse movement/clicks/scrolls and keyboard clicks. this is not paid, but it still needs work. feel free to publish better versions
make sure the .ico files are in the same folder as the .pyw file

## Standalone launchers
- `autosnap.pyw` – open the AutoSnap menu directly without the main MultiMouse window
- `autosnap_combi.pyw` – start the AutoSnap combi automation immediately; it launches Snapchat via a desktop shortcut (`%USERPROFILE%\\Desktop\\Snapchat.lnk`) and then begins the workflow. Press `Esc` to stop.

## Startup script
- `autosnap_startup.py` waits five seconds, opens Snapchat via the Windows zoekbalk using your calibrated position, clears unread snaps, sends one to all eight configured recipients and then runs AutoSnap combi using your saved settings.

## Settings
- In the AutoSnap menu you can save or load a configuration file. Enable **Instellingen automatisch laden bij start** in the settings wheel to load the last saved file automatically when the program starts.
- In AutoSnap combi, calibrate separate photo buttons for sending and replying.
