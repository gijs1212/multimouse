# multimouse
multimouse is an tinytask alternative (now called remouse) it records mouse movement/clicks/scrolls and keyboard clicks. this is not paid, but it still needs work. feel free to publish better versions
make sure the .ico files are in the same folder as the .pyw file

## HTML interface (optional)
If [`pywebview`](https://pywebview.flowrl.com/) is installed, an HTML/CSS/JavaScript
menu from `ui/index.html` is used for a cleaner look. Without it the classic Tk
interface is shown.
